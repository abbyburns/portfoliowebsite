<h3><a href="http://engineering.tcnj.edu/2016/06/08/tcnj-alumnus-david-talarico-wins-50000-to-fund-a-business-in-wind-power-2/"target="_blank">TCNJ Alumnus David Talarico wins $50,000 to fund a business in wind power</a></p>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
<p>On April 22, David Talarico, a TCNJ alumnus and current Rutgers student, won the top prize from the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored business pitch 
competition for his new device for harvesting wind power. Talarico and his group won $50,000, which will be used to help fund a new business around his 
novel wind-harnessing device.</p>
<p>Talarico and his group members, Antoni Milewski and Ryan Annibali, new graduates of the Rutgers MBA program, will advance on to the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s (DOE) national competition in Colorado in June 2016, where they will be competing for $100,000 that can be used to take the winning product to market.</p>
<p>Talarico, a doctoral mechanical engineering student, had the idea of building a company around a new device for harvesting wind power when he was working 
on his senior project as an undergraduate at TCNJ. He has been working on the winning technology for six years.</p>
<p>Although Talarico started his work on the wind-harnessing device at TCNJ for a senior project, he continued to develop the device in his spare time. 
It wasn’t until he went to Rutgers and took the course Collaborative for Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, which focused on taking new 
technologies to market, that he started to develop a start-up business around the device.</p>
<p>It was in this course that Talarico was put into a group with Annibali and Milewski, who chose to work on Talarico’s idea for their class project. 
His group members knew right away that Talarico was on to something with his device, “It became very clear that this was a viable technology,” Milewski 
said of Talarico’s idea.</p>
<p>Talarico and his team’s business plan included a 15-foot sail that moves back and forth on a track harvesting wind that is converted into energy. To put 
the device in perspective, it would only take 18 of their devices to generate enough power for all of a 17-story office building’s energy needs. The roof-top 
turbine is also a great price; it is about half the cost of a solar array that generates the same amount of power.</p>
<p>After working on the device for so long, Talarico was thrilled to have made progress with his team and realized his dream of building a company generated 
on wind power finally had the support of a serious entrepreneurial effort.</p>
<p>“It was a validation that I hadn’t been wasting my time,” he said.</p>
<p>The team then heard about the LaunchR pitch competition, and found that the U.S. Department of Energy had selected Rutgers as one of eight institutions 
in the country to host a regional Clean Tech University Prize Competitions. The regional competitions are designed to help fund and develop viable, innovative 
clean energy business ideas at universities across the country.</p>
<p>Talarico supports the DOE’s competitions that try to turn these clean energy business ideas into reality, as they work to ensure that the U.S. meets its 
goal of relying on renewable energy sources to provide half of the country’s power needs by 2050.</p>
<p>“The great thing about this space,” Talarico said, “is that even if we don’t win, everyone is trying to get this green technology out there, so it’s a win
 no matter what.”</p>
<p>Talarico and his team already won big with the top prize of $50,000 at the regional competition and the chance to win $100,000 at the national competition 
in June. They also received a mention of their device in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgQWiGVzRCc&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"> President Obama’s speech at Rutgers’ commencement.</a></p>

<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>On Wednesday, April 20th, The School of Engineering and School of Science sponsored a presentation by Dr. Hod Lipson, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, who spoke to a group of students and faculty at TCNJ about his research on self-aware and self-replicating robots. He is an award-winning researcher and director of the Creative Machines Lab where he discovers new ways to make machines that are creative and innovative.</p>
<p>Lipson focuses his research on evolutionary robotics, a branch of robotics that uses processes inspired from biological evolution to “breed” new robots, rather than design them manually. He started his lecture with a story of how he got to where he is now at Columbia, saying that it took years and “a lot of serendipity and research.” While researching robotics, Lipson learned the one major weakness of all robots- their inability to adapt to change. From then on, he made it his main goal to create robots that are self-aware and are able to adapt to the world around them.</p>
<p>The first two approaches Lipson discussed to building these self-aware robots were the “adapting in simulation approach,” where the robotics scientists evolve the controller in a virtual simulation first then try it in reality, and the “adapting in reality approach,” where the scientists evolve the controller in reality with no virtual simulation. After trying both of these approaches to building new robots, Lipson found problems with each; the first approach resulted in a “simulation-reality gap,” as the virtual simulations did not perform the same in reality, and the second approach took too much time and resulted in worn-out robots.</p> 
<p>Instead, Lipson combined the approaches to make the “simulation and reality approach,” which is essentially a cycle of evolving and collecting data. The first step is to evolve the virtual simulator, then evolve the robots, then try it in reality and collect sensor data (what the robot does and feels,) then take that data to breed better simulators, and continue the cycle until all the necessary data is collected.</p>
<p>Lipson used this approach to build a four-legged robot, which had to be self-aware and figure out how to move on its own. It took a few days of trial and error for the robot to learn about itself, as Lipson put it, “It does not know what it looks like, it wouldn’t even know if it was a snake or a tree,” but after four days it figured out that it had four legs. Lipson played a video of the robot forming a self-image, and the audience watched in amazement as the robot learned how to move forward on its own.</p> 
<p>Next in the video, Lipson decided to test how the robot performed with damage recovery by removing one its four legs. Remarkably, the robot’s dynamics changed, and it adapted to find a new way to move forward without the leg. In an interview on Columbia.edu, Lipson discusses what it felt like to watch a robot he built be self-aware, “It’s always surprising to see new systems evolve or learn on their own. Seeing a robot learn to do something you didn’t program it to do is a pretty amazing experience.”</p>
<p>Lipson also discussed the artificial intelligence software he created called Eureqa, which finds equations and mathematical relationships in data. The software is available for anyone to download, and is used by thousands to detect difficult calculations in big data. Machines with this software can formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret the results to discover new scientific laws.</p>
<p>Robots and machines that can model themselves have huge practical implications in the real world, says Lipson, and he hopes to continue to evolve self-aware robots over time. He believes that he is on his way to creating the holy grail of robotics, which would be a robot that is self-aware right out of a 3D printer, “I don’t know if we’ll get there in my lifetime,” Lipson says, “but we’re on the path that will eventually lead there.”</p> 

<h3><a href="https://engineering.tcnj.edu/2016/05/09/professor-jessons-tutorial-on-digital-signal-integrity/" target="_blank">TCNJ's Professor Jesson Tutorial on Signal Integrity</a></h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
<p>Professor Joe Jesson, an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at TCNJ, worked with his Spring 2014 ELC 441 Digital Engineering Systems Class to create a tutorial about digital signal integrity, which was published on Sonnetsoftware.com.</p>
<p>The advanced engineering class focused on the properties of high speed digital circuits. The students came up with individual projects that show mastery of the subject material, and as part of the projects, Jesson introduced a new electromagnetic modeling tool from the company Sonnet, which the students evaluated and explored in depth.</p> 
<p>Sonnet provides commercial software for solutions for high frequency EM analysis, and provides interfaces to work within major high frequency CAE design frameworks, as well as import and export to printed circuit board designs in DXF, GDSII and Gerber. The class looked at Sonnet as a planar EM solver with verified models for anisotropic dielectrics by major printed circuit board vendors.</p>
<p>During the class, the students looked at Verilog synthesis tools, Microwave Office and other traditional electromagnetic tools. One of the major parts of the course was learning how to properly lay out printed circuit board designs for high speed digital.</p>
<p>“The problem is the trend to faster and faster switch rates creates the need for such an electromagnetic modeling design tool into your design product layout,” Jesson says.</p> 
<p>Jesson had the students each put together a tutorial and report on how they used the electromagnetic modeling design tools and what they learned from each part of the class assignments. The class then put together all of their reports and created one broad base tutorial useful for generalized learning, which included basics through proper printed circuit board layout design.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of the technical-side,” Jesson says, “the people-side of it is that we had a good class response to putting together a tutorial.” Jesson found it a useful construct for the students because they learned how to teach others by creating a broad tutorial.</p>
<p>The tutorial was well-received by the President of Sonnet, and Jesson was asked if the tutorial could be put on Sonnet’s website as a resource. The tutorial can be found under the Resources section on the Sonnet homepage, under the sub-heading Applications, titled “Digital Signals Integrity Tutorial, Sonnet Microstrip Models.” The description reads, “This tutorial, authored by Professor Joe Jesson from the College of New Jersey, discusses Signal Integrity challenges and Sonnet's capabilities to model 3D planar circuits in the frequency domain.”</p>
<p>“It’s really by me and my class,” he corrects; on the tutorial pdf, Jesson credits all of his students by name on the title page, “I made sure I was inclusive of the whole class.”</p>
<p>Jesson was also very lucky to have Brazilian students in his class, who were very involved in the tutorial process, “The other cool thing that we got out of it was that almost a third of the class was from Brazil, and they volunteered to write the tutorials in Portuguese.”</p>
<p>The Portuguese version is also available to download, directly underneath the English tutorial. “That was kind of like serendipity,” he says, “I got a third of the class that are fluent in Portuguese!”</p> 
<p>Jesson says that he learned to teach as much as possible in writing, because he found that the Brazilian students understood reading more than spoken word. He made sure to carefully document everything he could for the Brazilian students, which led to his idea of actually using that documented work to create a tutorial with the class.</p> 
<p>“The cool thing is that now the students now have something published to Sonnet’s commercial website,” Jesson says. “The students were thrilled to have their name on it!”</p>
