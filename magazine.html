<h3>The Rise of Online Grocery Shopping</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>Between Chinese food dinners and late night pizza cravings, fast food delivery is all too familiar to us. But now, food delivery has extended to supermarkets and grocery stores- where consumers can have their favorite store do all of their food shopping for them.</p>

<p>There has been a rise in online grocery shopping sites and apps over the last few years, and with just the touch of a mouse or smart phone screen, users just have to choose food items to put in their cart, much like online shopping, and then choose when and where they want their groceries delivered.</p>

<p>In the article “The e-grocery explosion” on internetretailer.com, author Allison Enright said that in 2014, U.S. consumers, businesses, and government entities spent $1.46 trillion on food and beverages in grocery stores and other retailers and on away-from-home meals and snacks. Of the $1.46 trillion, about $18 to $24 billion was spent buying groceries online.</p>

<p>While the percentage of online grocery shopping is a relatively small fraction of the total dollars spent on food, the business has grown rapidly from past years; less than five years ago e-grocery sales accounted for less than 1% of total grocery sales. There is predicted to be an even bigger increase in online grocery sales in the next three years, up to a 21% increase each year, according to BI Intelligence, a subscription-based tech research service from Business Insider.</p>

<p>E-grocery shopping, as it is sometimes called, is marketed to people who have little time to go food shopping and/or don’t want to wait in lines at the store. Apps are made to be easy, user friendly, and to take as little time as possible. While some e-grocery businesses are independent, such as Postmates, Instacart, Fresh Direct and Favor Delivery, many popular stores like Walmart, Safeway, and even Amazon have their own grocery delivery apps.</p>

<p>A new survey of 12,000 U.S. grocery shoppers was conducted by grocery retail consultancy Brick Meets Click in March 2016, which found that buying groceries online is no longer a niche behavior; one in five U.S. consumers is now an active user of online grocery services.</p>

<p>The reasons why more and more people are using grocery shopping apps are as simple as you may think; it is all about convenience. An article on Forbes.com, “What's the Future for Online Grocery Shopping?,” concludes the main reasons why people use online grocery sites, “39% to save time, 36% to save money, 27% to save driving/gas, and 15% to order food/drink in large quantities.”</p>

<p>Leah Ingram, author and founder of the popular frugal-living blog called Suddenly Frugal, wrote a review of Peapod, a popular grocery delivery service app. In an interview with Ingram, she agrees that the main reason she shops online for food is for convenience, “I shop online for food because I'm busy and it saves me time.” Ingram finds Peapod very easy to use as it only take a few minutes to order groceries, “Peapod makes it easy by remembering what I've ordered in the past and then I can just check a box and add it to my cart.”</p>

<p>In the internetretailer.com article “How an online organic food retailer acquires customers on social networks” Cambria Jacobs, vice president of marketing and customer service at Door to Door Organics, an online retailer that delivers organic foods, says that 95% of their customers are 25 to 45-year-old women, mainly mothers who shop for their household. “They feel successful by providing good quality sustainably produced food to their families,” Jacobs says.</p>
 
<p>The majority of the comments and reviews on the company’s social media accounts are from mothers who say how convenient it is to order food from home while watching their kids, instead of taking two hours out of their day to go to the store. Blogger and full-time mom Jessica Puga from OrganicDealDiva.com reviewed Door to Door Organics, and says that she uses online food delivery services all the time and rarely goes to the grocery store now.</p>

<p>In an interview with Puga, she says her main reason for continuing to use services like Door to Door Organics is because of how convenient online grocery shopping is, “I don't always have time to get enough fresh food for my family, so it's nice to come home to a box of food at your doorstep, and not having to spend hours at the grocery store. Plus bringing little kids to the grocery store is a nightmare!”</p>

<p>While online food delivery services continue to grow rapidly, one can’t help but think about the future of brick and mortar stores. Will the grocery store as we know it soon be a thing of the past?</p>

<p>Ingram believes that although online grocery shopping will continue to grow, grocery stores will not disappear. She says that we are so used to running out to the grocery store to pick up things we forgot, and shopping online for one ingredient at a time will not be very practical, “People always need something at the last minute and online services like Peapod often have a minimum turnaround time of 24 hours. So if you're cooking something and forgot an ingredient, you're going to need to run to the grocery store.”</p>

<p>While people may still occasionally need to go to the grocery store, there is no doubt than online grocery shopping will greatly affect brick and mortar stores. In the consumeraffairs.com article “Does online grocery shopping threaten supermarkets?,” author Mark Huffman, a consumer news reporter, compares online grocery shopping to Uber. The Uber app is marketed as a delivery service, much like online grocery apps.</p>

<p>Uber and online grocery shopping apps have another similarity; they both have a highly disruptive effect on long established business sectors. Uber has had a huge effect on the taxi industry, and online food delivery apps are having a great effect on grocery stores.</p>

<p>Many brick and mortar supermarkets are embracing online shopping by creating their own online delivery services, which may seem like a good idea at first. However, Huffman says this actually may cause more harm than good, “While traditional grocery stores may not fear online shopping the way taxi companies fear Uber, new research suggests they may be hurting themselves by promoting online shopping.”</p>

<p>This is mainly because consumers buy fewer items and spend less money when they shop online, because they do not make as many impulse buys. Huffman discusses a study conducted by the market research firm eDigitalResearch, which found that 29% of respondents feel that they make far fewer impulse purchases online than in store.</p>

<p>“Supermarkets go to great lengths to use store layout and shelf design to encourage consumers to pick up things not on their lists,” Huffman states. “Sure, a consumer might order something online they hadn't planned to, but the research suggests it doesn't happen all that often.” These findings serve as a warning to brick and mortar supermarkets, and sooner or later online shopping is going to affect their bottom line.</p>

<p>Online grocery shopping will only continue to grow in future years. While shopping in-store may still be the normal way to shop for groceries for a few more years, it is not unreasonable to think that brick and mortar stores may eventually be a thing of the past, as technology continues to dominate our world.</p> 


<h3>Social Media’s Effect on Communication</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>Michale Sevy, an Interactive Producer, traveler, and photographer, decided to challenge himself to do something that most teens and young adults wouldn’t want to do for a day; He gave up social media, for two whole months.</p>

<p>As a photographer, social media is important for Sevy to share his work with the world, especially on Instagram. Before his 60-day break from social media, he had a 600-day streak of posting photos every single day on the app. This streak stopped one day when he realized that he was only posting photos for attention, not for himself. While on his social media break, he realized how obsessed everyone around him was with their phones, and how much we relied on media to communicate with others.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old says that while he relies on group texts to connect with his family, he feels that smart phones can actually put some distance between families, because we rely on what we see on social media rather than communicating about what is really going on.</p> 

<p>In fact, since his mother got an iPhone, they don’t talk on the phone as much as they used to, “She is able to see more of what is superficially going on in my life via social channels. She and I used to talk with frequency, but that has since waned,” he says. “That, in my opinion, is an example of how social networks have ruined some relationships.”</p>

<p>Giving up social media for a limited amount of time and then writing about it has become popular for bloggers as a challenge. For example, Her Campus posts many blog articles in which the authors, usually college-aged girls, go without social media for a week or a month and write about how hard it was. Other popular sites like BuzzFeed create videos of a few people going without their phones or social media, and recap on what they’ve learned from the experience.</p> 

<p>The fact that articles about deleting social media accounts for short periods of time are so popular- (the BuzzFeed video has over 4 million views on YouTube,) shows just how prevalent social media is in our lives, and how much we as a society rely on it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In fact, technology usage in general has drastically increased in recent years, especially in the younger generations. One study, conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, “Generation M2: Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds,” found that kids in this age range “spend more time with media than in any other activity besides (maybe) sleeping- an average of more than 7½ hours a day, seven days a week.”</p>

<p>With all of this time spent with media, it is no surprise that face-to-face communication is declining, as most of it is now done through text or on social media. This is resulting in serious consequences, especially for kids and teens.</p> 

<p>The report “The Effect of Technology on Face-to-Face Communication” by Emily Drago, a Strategic Communications major at Elon University, discusses many studies that have examined the relationship between the presence of phones and the quality of in-person conversations. One study titled “The iPhone Effect: The Quality of In-Person Social Interactions in the Presence of Mobile Devices,” concluded that “People who had conversations in the absence of mobile devices reported higher levels of empathetic concern, while those conversing in the presence of a mobile device reported lower levels of empathy.” In another study, “Can you connect with me now? How the presence of mobile communication technology influences face-to-face conversation quality,” the authors found evidence that devices “have negative effects on closeness, connection, and conversation quality, especially notable when individuals are engaging in personally meaningful topics.”</p> 

<p>These studies show that phones and social media are having a very negative effect on the younger generations, and with the decrease of in-person interactions, kids and teens actually have significant consequences for their development of social skills and their presentation of self.</p>

<p>To counteract these consequences, one family took the “social media detox” trend one step further, and instead of going on a break for a limited amount of time, they decided to turn off all media completely every weekend.</p>

<p>In the article “How Our Digital Devices Are Affecting Our Personal Relationships” from www.wbur.org, author Iris Adler describes the family’s weekend break from media as a Sabbath: “It’s not a religious Sabbath; they call it their Internet Sabbath. From Friday night through Sunday evening, there are no video games, no computers and no smartphones.”</p> 

<p>William Powers, the father in the family, says that it was more difficult than he thought at first, “It almost had an existential feeling of, ‘I don’t know who I am with the Internet gone.’ But after a few months it hardened into a habit and we all began to realize we were gaining a lot from it.”</p>

<p>Sherry Turkle, MIT professor and psychologist, says in the article that there are many benefits of digital technology, but we still have a lot to learn about how to use it without undermining our values. With teens relying so heavily on communication through text, Turkle has found that many young people have trouble with phone conversations, and are even more intimidated by in-person conversation, “She worries that as we ramp up our digital communication, we are ‘dumbing down’ our conversations,” Adler writes.</p> 

<p>Turkle also says that digital communication is really not the same as speaking face-to-face with your friends, and that it is easy to fake feelings and emotions over text, “It gives us that sense of connection without the demands of intimacy and the responsibilities of intimacy.” While using media to stay in contact with friends is perfectly fine, having deep and meaningful conversations are much more effective in person, and the younger generation is falling behind on that.</p>

<p>Ananya, a Full-Time PhD student and blogger in London who did not want to give her last name for privacy reasons, also tried the so-called “social media detox” when she went without social media for two weeks in January. She wrote about her experience on her blog, NamasteFromAnanya.com, and noticed how obsessed others are with their phones, how they aren’t fully present in conversations because of the need to look on social media, and realized that life without social media is actually refreshing and reduces stress.</p> 

<p>In an interview with the blogger, she said that her experience without social media highlighted the extent it has become engrained in what we do with people. Whether people are taking pictures just to post on Instagram and Facebook, or when friends open Snapchat on their phones and tell their friends to “do that again” because it was so funny it needs to be shared, social media is a huge part of how we interact with people, even in person.</p>

<p>Social media can be a great tool to connect with people all over the world, but if the younger generation does not cut back on the time spent on their phones, the future of conversations will be very different. Face-to-face communication is crucial for meaningful conversations, empathy close connections to others, and communication in the workplace.</p> 

<p>Sevy says that social media is often the lever we keep pushing because we are unfulfilled elsewhere, but it does not have to be an addiction if we can find fulfillment outside of it.</p>

<p>“It is all about balance,” Sevy says. “The problem is teens are still working on that self-moderation factor. It will be very interesting to see where today's teens end up as tomorrow's adults.”</p>


<h3>Top Pros and Cons of Social Media on Mental Health</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>Social media has become an important part of our everyday life, and is used widely by people all over the world. As we all know, there are many positive and negative effects that social media has on society. Before you make your own opinion about whether the positives outweigh the negatives, here’s a list of the top three pros and cons that social media has on mental health.</p> 
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p> 
<p>Addiction</p> 
<p>In an email interview with Imtiaz Ali, owner and chief editor of Techbead.com and author of the article “Positive and Negative Effects of Social Media on Society,” he says that, the cons of social media “do a lot [more] damage to society than the pros that social media gives to society.” Studies, including the study “Online Social Networking and Addiction—A Review of the Psychological Literature” from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, show that users can become addicted to social media sites, often leading to focusing problems and lower motivation. There are many reasons why people use social media so often, but Ali says it usually has to do with distraction and boredom relief- and can result in teens using social media whenever they have a spare minute.</p> 
<p>Depression</p>
<p>Social media users tend to promote their happiest moments online, which can result in others feeling less happy with their own lives. The article “Social media: how does it affect our mental health and well-being?” in Medical News Today discusses the survey Anxiety UK conducted on social media use and its effects on emotions in 2012, “The survey found that 53% of participants said social media sites had changed their behavior, while 51% of these said the change had been negative.” Those who said their behavior changes negatively said they felt less confident when they compared their achievements against their friends.</p>
<p>Cyberbullying</p> 
<p>Cyberbullying is the most serious negative effect social media has on mental health. This is very widespread with teens today, and has led to many teen suicides around the world. The article “Cyber-Bullying and its Effect on our Youth” from Osteopathic.org states that kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness, and poor sleep, and 95% of teenagers who use social media have witnessed cyberbullying.</p> 

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>Social media also has many positive effects, and is extremely important in our everyday life today, as it connects us with people all over the world and we can find others online with similar interests or struggles. In an email interview with Mariel Norton, journalist for thenextweb.com, she says that social media is especially important for communication in today’s society, “Without social media, we would not have access to information so readily and instantaneously. Without social media, we would not have the ease and convenience of networking with niche audiences and connecting with minority users.” Online communication has changed the way we talk with others, and has removed many barriers standing in the way of communicating with who we want, about what we want to discuss.</p> 
<p>Friendship/Building Relationships</p> 
<p>Before social media, the only way to meet new people was to develop a relationship face-to-face. Building relationships online can be a positive effect for those who are shy or have social anxiety, where friends can easily be made by communicating over the internet. Also, with the use of social networks, it is much easier to find people who share similar interests as you, making it simple to bond and create a relationship.</p>
<p>Positive Change</p>
<p>Social media can be used in a way to create positive change. Through groups on social networks, it is easy to find others who are going through the same problems and support each other through the difficult times. In an online article on Cnn.com, “Teen Depression and How Social Media Can Help or Hurt,” a teen named Matthew, who was diagnosed with depression, found a support system online. He used social media sites to offer support to those who struggled with mental illness, “It has been clear that allowing Matthew to have his own voice… has strengthened his resolve to stay on a positive path,” says his mother. Although social media can have negative effects on mental health, people can easily come together and promote a positive change.</p> 


<h3>Alexandra Penn- Founder of Champions Against Bullying</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>Alexandra Penn has many titles and responsibilities, but has just one goal: to prevent bullying and violence so children of all ages can have the lives they deserve.</p> 
<p>Penn is an educator, author, key-note speaker, workshop leader, mother, grandmother, Crisis Intervention Specialist, Workplace Safety Consultant, Internationally Certified Trainer in Youth Violence Prevention, and most importantly, founder of the anti-violence organization Champions Against Bullying, the longest standing anti-bullying organization.</p>
<p>When describing what an average day is like for a woman with so many titles and responsibilities, Penn laughs and says she couldn’t really say, “Every day is different!”</p>
<p>She could be traveling anywhere in North America for conferences, workshops, or speeches. She could be counseling mothers and families on bullying and violence prevention strategies. She could also be working on new books and resources used in her workshops for teachers, parents and children of all ages.</p> 
<p>Penn was born in Canada, and attended The University of Toronto, majoring in Psychology and Journalism. While she lives in Vancouver, she spends he majority of her time traveling around North America for her job. In the past year she has spent two months in Los Angeles, three months in Vancouver, then will travel to Toronto for May and June.</p>
<p>While thinking of how often she travels, Penn pauses for a moment then laughs and says “Well, maybe I’m homeless!”</p>
<p>But traveling the globe to spread her messages wasn’t always part of her routine. Her career started at the Toronto Board of Education in Canada as a special education counselor, and found that important things were going under the radar. When she took a job editing a children’s book, she says that conversations with the author led to the development of Champions Against Bullying in 2003. Penn decided that the growing problem of bullying in schools needed to be addressed, and the anti-bullying organization was formed.</p>
<p>Penn describes Champions Against Bullying as an “anti-violence organization that provides support to kids.” The organization works with kids of all ages, from pre-school to elementary school, all over North America. Through her years working with the organization, she strongly believes that no child deserves to be bullied or hurt, and that we are all responsible to prevent bullying in any way we can.</p> 
<p>“Kids are taking their lives,” Penn says. “This shouldn’t happen. We are all responsible.” But not enough people understand how much of a problem bullying is.</p>
<p>“It could happen to their kids, their neighbors… it could happen to anyone.”  Penn says. But people are still not aware of the severity bullying, and how often it actually happens and the severe consequences that could result from it.</p>
<p>Penn tells the story of one mother she helped with counseling, of a 5-year-old girl who started a new school in Kindergarten. While the mother was giving her a bath, the young girl said “Quick, quick, put more bubbles in! I don’t want to see my body.” The little girl was bullied because of her weight, even when she was only five years old.</p>
<p>“This story is a heartbreaker,” says Penn. “It really shows the severity of bullying even at such a young age.” This was just one instance that shows that Penn’s work in anti-bullying prevention is obviously needed in our society today, even at a very young age.</p>  
<p>One of her greatest accomplishments was co-authoring the Disney Parent-To-Parent interactive award-winning resource, “The No-Nonsense Guide To Kids’ Bullying Solutions,” that teaches kids and parents about bullying and how to prevent it from happening. The CD-ROM was honored as “Best Educational Product” by the Ministry of Education for two consecutive years.</p>
<p>Penn says that the CD-ROM is now slightly outdated, and would love to transform the contents into an app to reach a wider audience today.</p>
<p>One of Penn’s many titles is “Crisis Intervention Specialist,” which means that she helps those who have had a crisis and helps them restore their lives. When a crisis occurs, Penn says, “People get out of balance.”</p>
<p>Penn helps them restore their balance, and minimize the potential psychological trauma they could face if they went through recovery alone. She says most people do not have great coping mechanisms, and as a Crisis Intervention Specialist, she increases their bounce back time, and helps people “return to the level of functioning before the crisis.”</p>
<p>Working with people who have gone through traumatic or violent experiences, Penn has had many challenging moments in her career. But, there are also many rewarding moments that make it all worth it.</p>
<p>Knowing she helped prolong a child’s life is her most rewarding moment in her career. Bullying and violence make too many kids take their own lives, she says, because they don’t see anything in the future to make them keep going or wanting to live. Penn helps kids see that there are ways to cope with bullying and to prevent it from happening again, and that there are many reasons to keep living.</p>
<p>Bullying is just as prevalent as it has always been, but it has taken on a new form: Cyberbullying. “Physical bullying may have decreased, but cyberbullying has increased. Kids have found other areas of exclusion,” Penn says.</p>
<p>“At one time you could just go home and have a safe haven, where no one could reach you. Now, there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide,” Penn says, referring to how social media has changed the way kids are being bullied. Kids are always on their phones and computers, where anyone can reach them and say anything they want.</p>
<p>Penn says that parents must get involved, but most don’t realize the gravity and repercussions cyberbullying could have on a child or teen. She also insists that schools put a policy into place, because when children do not feel safe, they will not learn.</p>
<p>“If kids don’t feel physically or emotional safe, they’re not going to learn,” Penn says.</p>
<p>As for the future, Penn says that Champions Against Bullying is always working on new plans. She recently wrote a book for pre-school aged children, “There’s A Bully In My Belly,” and discusses that it is important to start teaching children about bullying early. She also included a guidebook for teachers and parents, with exercises pertaining to the story and to enhance the learning.</p>
<p>She stresses that parents have an important role in teaching their kids not to bully, “It is a form of bullying when we shut kids down.” They ask so many questions because they are curious and are motivated to learn. And sometimes that may annoy parents, like when kids ask why the sky is blue, “and we just want to say ‘it’s blue because it’s blue!’” Penn laughs.</p>
<p>But children form ideas and habits from a very young age, and Penn believes it is important to give kids the right tools of language, emotional and social skills that will stick with them for life.</p>
<p>Alexandra Penn brings over two decades of experience as a leading advocate for children. Her work with bullying and violence prevention is making a difference, and inspires others to join the movement to end bullying for good.</p>
