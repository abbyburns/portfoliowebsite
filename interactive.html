<h3>Top 5 Apps for Affordable Teen Fashion</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>1.	Vinted- This app makes is easy for girls to buy clothes from other’s closets, sell their own pieces, or swap one article of clothing for another. It’s easy to locate attire; just select your size, type of clothing you’re looking for, and the brand of clothing you want to purchase. Vinted lets you search others closets for a discount, often more than 50% of the original price, and can also help you add some cash to your wallet.</p>

<p>2.	Tobi- This site has great teen fashion, for half the price. From dresses to swimwear to jackets, Tobi has the latest styles with the most affordable prices. With most items selling for less than $25, this app is perfect for girls looking for the latest trends while on a budget. The site even offers free shipping on all orders!</p>

<p>3.	Wanelo- This app is one of the more popular online shopping apps/website, and with good reason. Wanelo has items from clothing to accessories to shoes; everything you could possibly need to fill your wardrobe, without breaking the bank. After “liking” pictures of things you want to purchase, Wanelo updates your feed to similar items to make it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for. Popular stores like Forever 21 and H&M have their own Wanelo pages, to create a site with all of your favorite items in one convenient place.</p>

<p>4.	FashionClyp- This app makes it easy to find offers and valid coupons at any time, saving you time and money. It includes a store tracker, which provides a map of stores near you, and access to personalized coupons. Clothes from top name brands are marked down, and the coupons add an even bigger discount to the latest styles.</p>

<p>5.	Twice- Another app that allows you to buy and sell clothing, this app is great for finding deals and earning cash for your old clothes. Items are on sale for up to 90% less than retail price, and selling clothes is easier than ever. Simply send you items to Twice, accept an offer, decline and have the clothes sent back, or decide to give your clothing to charity.</p> 

<h3>A Better Shopping Experience: Online and In Store Shopping </h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>We all love the internet, but it’s important to stop shopping online for everything and go back to the traditional shopping experience- actually going inside the store.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, online shopping is definitely a great way to buys things when you don’t have the time to go to the store. I have many favorite shopping apps that I use when I can get a good discount every once in a while. But that’s the thing- online shopping should only be used when necessary, not for everything you buy.</p> 

<p>Online shopping has skyrocketed over the last few years, and it is on its way to becoming more popular than traditional shopping. Nowadays, people are buying things online when they could just as quickly drive down the street to the local store, pick up what they need while talking to employees that work there- (instead of trusting reviews on the internet,) and bring it home that same day.</p> 

<p>While online shopping is quick and easy and can be done from the comfort of your own home or while on-the-go from your mobile phone, retail stores are in crisis.</p>

<p>I am not against the internet, and I admit I like to occasionally online shop myself, but I don’t think that everything should be bought online all the time. It’s important to keep retail stores alive. Retail is a huge source of jobs, and when everyone choses the website over the store, those employees suffer.</p>

<p>No matter what the product is, customers expect they can purchase it online, without having to go through the “hassle” of shopping in retail stores. But shopping does not have to be a hassle. Going into a store is part of the buying experience; you can see the item in person before buying, talk to the employees who have expert knowledge about the product, and have an all-around better experience communicating to people rather than online shopping by yourself.</p> 

<p>It’s possible to bring online and in-store shopping together, and in my opinion, this is the top option to create the best shopping experience for all consumers. Many customers would rather shop online for many reasons, but I think that bringing some aspects from online shopping to in store shopping will produce a way of shopping that will keep the online sites and the stores alive.</p>

<p>Looking on the stores website is a great part of online shopping, because it’s the best way to familiarize yourself with the products instead of wandering around the store. If this digital inventory of products is somehow shown in stores, I think that shopping would be a much easier and more fun experience. Customers could scroll through the inventory while in store, and be directed to the product. This is better than online shopping because it’s always better to see the product in person before buying and to learn from the expert advice from employees.</p>

<p>Another reason to shop in store instead of online: Just think about how much money you’d save without all of those insane shipping fee costs.</p> 

<h3>Profiles of TCNJ Alumna</h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>

<p>Nicole Mulvaney, a recent alumna from The College of New Jersey, transferred to the college in 2011 after obtaining an associate's degree from Ocean County Community College. She graduated from TCNJ in May 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Professional Writing. Now at 24 years old, Mulvaney is a full-time staff writer at The Times of Trenton.</p> 
<p>Q. Where did you intern while in college/ after graduating?</p> 
<p>A. “At TCNJ I interned with J-14 magazine and some blogs.  I was also News Editor of Her Campus, TCNJ’s online magazine.</p>  
<p>Q. What job do you currently hold?</p> 
<p>A. “[The summer after graduating,] I became a part-time staff writer at The Times of Trenton and eventually became full-time doing what I do now, which is covering Princeton, East Windsor, West Windsor, Hightstown and a range stories for the newspaper.”</p> 
<p>Q.	How did you get the job?</p> 
<p>A. “During my last semester in Professor Shaw’s class, we partnered with The Times of Trenton and worked with editors there to pitch stories, which were edited and published in the newspaper. I graduated TCNJ in May 2013 and began interning full-time with The Times of Trenton a week later. That was how I met my current editor-in-chief and how I ended up in my current position today.”</p> 
<p>Q. Do you have any funny/entertaining stories about your job?</p> 
<p>A. “James Franco came to West Windsor this winter to shoot one of his newest films “The Sound and the Fury.” That was a fun story to write as I got to chat with Franco for a bit. But on Aug. 1, my editor-in-chief sent me on an assignment, telling me he heard there was a big production crew setting up in front of Princeton University’s Nassau Hall and that maybe Franco was back to shoot summer scenes.  So I went to check it out and instead stumbled upon my now fiancé who proposed that day in front of Nassau Hall! The “production crew” didn’t exist at all and it was just a distraction technique. Little did I know, my fiancé coordinated the meeting with my editor in advance, and it all came together smoothly. It was the best “story” I ever covered, which ended up being my own.”</p> 

<p>Jamie Primeau is a recent aluma from TCNJ, who graduated in May 2013. She spent her time at college being actively involved in the school newspaper, TCNJ’s Ed2010 chapter, and four internships. Today at 23 years old, Primeau works as an editorial assistant at Scholastic and as a freelance writer for a women's lifestyle website called Bustle.</p>  
<p>Q. Did you intern anywhere during college/ right after graduating?</p> 
<p>A. “Yes! During college I had four internships. I spent a summer at The Courier News (a daily newspaper in Central Jersey). Then I interned at two magazines: Cosmopolitan (as an editorial intern) and Seventeen (in the features department and then again on their web team.) I think what helped me land those internships was my on-campus activities. I was super involved in the school newspaper, The Signal, which is where I gained valuable hands-on experience. (Plus, it was just a lot of fun!) I was also in TCNJ's Ed2010 chapter, where I learned a lot about networking and the magazine industry. Something else that's helped my career is an organization called New York Women in Communications. I received a scholarship through them my junior year and they set me up with an internship at Seventeen, which was an amazing experience. NYWICI is a really great support network for women in the communications industry.”</p> 
<p>Q. How long have you been at your current job, and how did you get the job?</p> 
<p>A. “I've been an editorial assistant at Scholastic since March. I work for a classroom magazine for middle and high school students called Choices. It focuses on teens' health, well-being, and life skills. I found out about the job through word-of-mouth. One of my former internship bosses recommended me for it. So I think it's so important to form genuine connections at internships and keep in touch with those people. I also had to do an interview and complete an edit test, but I think her recommendation is what set me apart. Also, I write freelance for a women's lifestyle website called Bustle. I cover celebrity news for them two days a week. I've been doing that since June. I started reading the site a year ago when another person I knew from an internship began working there. She also put in a good word for me — so again, I can't emphasize enough how much it helps having people that will vouch for you and support you in your career.”</p> 
<p>Q. Are you hoping to do anything different in the future?</p> 
<p>A. “Honestly, I really love what I'm doing right now and wouldn't change a thing. It's a perfect balance between more serious content (teen health) and fun, slightly silly stuff (pop culture). As far as the future, I think I'd be happy doing anything that involves writing!”</p>
