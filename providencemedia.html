		<h4>By: Abby Burns</h4>
<p>From beer and whiskey to hard cider, area brewers are kicking up their seasonal offerings.</p>
<p>As summer fades into autumn, fruity and sweet drinks begin to dwindle away, while spicy and bold ones come into play. Now’s the time for apple, 
pumpkin, cinnamon and caramel flavors, reminding everyone that it’s actually tolerable that summer has to come to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Liquid Pumpkin Pie</p></strong>
<p>The only thing better than eating pumpkin pie is drinking it, right? Newport Storm Brewery’s R.I.P.umpkin beer is basically liquid pumpkin pie with 
three pounds of pumpkin per keg. <i>293 JT Connell Highway, Newport. 401-849-5232, NewportStorm.com</i></p>

<p><strong>Enjoy the Fall Breeze</p></strong>
<p>Grey Sail Brewing brews their own Oktoberfest-style seasonal ale, Autumn Winds, available now through November. Brewed with five premium German malts
to create a bready aroma, dense creamy head and brilliant garnet red color, this is a great beer to sip on while sitting outside, enjoying the cool autumn 
breeze. <i>63 Canal Street, Westerly. 401-212-7592, GreySailBrewing.com</i></p>

<p><strong>Pursuit of Hoppiness</p></strong>
<p>Narragansett Brewing Company brews a German Oktoberfest-style beer balanced with four varieties of malts and two styles of hops. The Gansett Fest Lager 
is the right choice if you are on the lookout for a seasonal beer that is easy to drink, with a rich malt profile that perfectly complements the crisp, 
hoppy flavor. <i>461 Main Street, Pawtucket. 401-437-8970, NarragansettBeer.com</i></p>

<p><strong>Not Just Another Pumpkin Beer</p></strong>
<p>Revival Brewing Co. knows how to make a strong pumpkin beer unlike any other. With an ABV of 9%, the Bushido Pumpkin Ale is not for the weak of heart. 
The beer is made with ginger, lemongrass, rose hips and pumpkin, and fermented with Saki and Octoberfest yeast, creating a unique twist on a classic flavor
you need to try this fall. <i>505 Atwood Avenue, Cranston. 401-372-7009, RevivalBrewing.com</i></p>

<p><strong>Cookie Heaven</p></strong>
<p>Pumpkin and apple are very popular fall flavors, but who can forget about oatmeal raisin cookies? Often overlooked because of the raisins, it’s a shame 
that this cookie doesn’t get as much love as it deserves. For those who agree, check out Crooked Current Brewery for their mouthwatering Oatmeal Raisin Stout,
 a dark beer that tastes like a dessert in a glass. <i>560 Mineral Spring Avenue, Pawtucket. 401-473-8312, CrookedCurrentBrewery.com</i></p>

<p><strong>PB and Beer</p></strong>
<p>Foolproof Brewing Company decided to make a seasonal beer with peanut butter, because why not? The Peanut Butter Raincloud is so uniquely flavorful, 
and the perfect Halloween beer to drink while eating Reese’s cups and Peanut M&M’s. <i>241 Grotto Ave #1, Pawtucket. 401-721-5970, FoolproofBrewing.com</i></p> 

<p><strong>Pumpkin Spice with a Kick</p></strong>
<p>If you’ve ever asked the question “Why are there so many seasonal beers, but no seasonal whiskies?” you’re not alone. Sons of Liberty also had this 
question, which inspired them to create their Pumpkin Spice Flavored Whiskey. This brewery really stepped up the fall alcohol game, as each year they 
invite friends and family to cut, core, roast and press 32,000lbs of pumpkins. Plenty of autumnal spices are also added including cinnamon, clove, allspice, 
sweet orange peel and vanilla. <i>1425 Kingstown Road, South Kingstown. 401-284-4006, SOLSpirits.com</i></p>

<p><strong>Farm Fresh</p></strong>
<p>If you’re looking for a beer with an authentic pumpkin flavor, check out the Tilted Barn Brewery for their Jack pumpkin ale. This amber colored ale is 
brewed with pumpkins grown right on their farm – it doesn’t get any fresher than that. With just a subtle hint of spices, the pumpkin and malt are the 
main flavors in this seasonal brew. <i>1 Helmsley Place, Exeter. TiltedBarnBrewery.com</i></p>

		<h4>By: Abby Burns</h4>
<p>The annual celebration of creative thinkers gathers all over the state</p>
<p>Design Week RI (DWRI) is an 11-day, statewide celebration, with over 35 events taking place all over Rhode Island from September 14-25. This year marks 
the third annual event hosted by DESIGNxRI, featuring nationally and locally renowned designers taking part in panels, showcases and more. Here’s a sneak 
peek at just a few of the exciting events planned so far.</p>

<p>First, join KITE Architect’s Albert Garcia, along with interior designer Libby Slader and Providence Revolving Fund’s Clarke Schoettle for “KITE 
Architects and Cuba,” as they discuss their individual perspectives into Cuba’s important design culture. Albert will also share the challenges he faced 
while being in a country where the profession of architecture was essentially banned for a generation. September 14. 6pm, location TBD.</p>

<p>Don’t miss the kickoff event, PVD Design Catalyst Party at the Westminster Arcade. This fundraising event will feature displays, performance antics, 
food trucks and more. All proceeds support DESIGNxRI, and attendees can bid on auction items created by the grantees themselves, or enter the raffle for 
a chance to win signature prizes. September 16. 6-10pm at the Westminster Arcade. 65 Weybosset Street.</p>

<p>As the only event in Rhode Island to join in The United State of Women campaign spearheaded by the White House, Women in Design celebrates the successes
 of female designers. The challenges and opportunities around design, gender and culture in society will be discussed during this powerful panel of women
 design leaders.</p>

		<h4>By: Abby Burns</h4> 
		
<p>There's more to do at City Hall than pay some taxes. Food trucks are rolling by to feed the masses</p>		

<p>When you’re thinking of where to go on a Thursday night for dinner, odds are City Hall isn’t on your list. But this summer, Providence City Council is
 changing that – at least for one night each month – with Food Truck Nights at City Hall. The fourth Thursday of each month through September will 
 feature more than ten food trucks lined up around the intersection of Eddy and Fulton Street.</p>

<p>The food trucks scheduled for the each month will provide a wide variety of menu items from snacks at Friskie Fries, main meals at Buddha Belly, 
Open Season, SoulFull Fried Chicken, Gastros, Rhodie’s Food Truck and Rhode Rage, to dessert at Sarcastic Sweets, O’Crepe and The Big Freezy. 
August 25 and September 22, 5-8pm.</p>	
					
	<h3><a href="http://heyrhody.com/stories/Body-Worlds-Vital-Providence,19577?" target="_blank">An Art Exhibit With Guts Makes its Providence Debut</a></h3>
		<h4>By: Abby Burns</h4> 
<p>The world renown Body Worlds gives us an inside look at ourselves</p>
<p>Body Worlds Vital is an immersive, multimedia experience that celebrates the potential of the human body while promoting healthy lifestyle changes. 
The exhibition – on display at the Providence Museum Gallery at The Rhode Island Convention Center from June 30 through January – features real human bodies,
 including 200 specimens and 13 complete plastinated bodies, which stem primarily from a body donation program managed by the Institute for Plastination 
 with a roster of more than 14,000 donors.</p>
<p>The bodies on display are preserved through the groundbreaking science of plastination invented by Dr. Gunther von Hagens. Bodily fluids and fat are 
extracted then replaced with plastic, allowing visitors to see the inside of the human body up close and personal, and learn how their bodies work.</p>

<p>The bodies are examined through displays of distress and disease, while offering inspirational insights about the body’s virtuosity and resilience. 
Visitors will see first-hand how lifestyle choices affect their bodies with side-by-side comparisons of healthy organs to lungs diseased from smoking and a 
liver damaged by alcoholism.</p>
