<h2><a name="Her Campus"></a>A few of my favorite Her Campus articles</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/tcnj/jerry-greenfield-ben-jerry-s" target="blank">Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry's</a></h3>
<p>On October 18, 2016, TCNJ students were given the pleasure to listen and speak to Jerry Greenfield, cofounder of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. 
Jerry spoke to the audience about the unconventional start of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, and how the company prides itself by spreading awareness 
of social and environmental issues. We were very grateful to sit down and interview Jerry before his lecture.</p>

<p>HC “You and Ben were very vocal about supporting every citizen’s right to vote with Democracy Awakening, why do you think it’s so important for 
the younger generation specifically to register to vote and to exercise that right, especially in this year’s election?”</p>

<p>Jerry Greenfield: “Well I think it’s important every election; I think the problem we face in this country is that elections are really controlled 
by campaign contributions, which are supported by millionaires and billionaires and huge corporations. So they are the ones who are really deciding 
elections in our country. We need people to speak out and get big money out of politics, and that’s why Ben and I were willing to get arrested in 
Washington, DC to try to help move that along.”</p>

<p>HC: “What made you and Ben decide to use your ice cream’s popularity to bring awareness to important and controversial issues, such as the launch 
of “Save Our Swirled” to bring awareness to climate change, and “I Dough, I Dough” to recognize the right of all couples to marry?”</p>

<p>JG: “I think businesses, particularly big businesses, are usually concerned about one thing, and that is making as much money as they can. 
And Ben and I have always felt like business is like a neighbor in the community, it just happens to be a wealthier neighbor, but that it needs to use 
its power and its voice to talk about issues and to bring about a more just and sustainable world. Otherwise, you have this incredibly powerful force- 
which is business- just thinking about itself and not thinking about the common good.”</p>

<p>HC: “Do you have any tips or advice for students who have dreams to start their own small business?”</p>

<p>JG: “My advice is that you should try to bring your own personal values into your business, because it will make it that much more motivating 
for you if you have something you’re doing that you’re passionate about and is aligned with your own personal values. I think for Ben and me 
it was also helpful to start small, because when you start small it forces you to learn all the ins and outs of a business- you can’t really 
through money at problems you have to get in right there and roll up your sleeves and figure it out.”During his lecture, Jerry first talked 
about how he and Ben Cohen, cofounder, met in middle school gym class, or how Jerry explains it, they were the “slowest and fattest kids in 
the class, and became friends in the back of the pack.” They were friends throughout school, and Jerry graduated pre-med from Oberlin College, 
with the goal to go to medical school, but was rejected twice. Ben never even graduated from college, dropping out of several schools. Jerry 
said that at this point, they were both “essentially failing at everything we tried to do,” so they chose to start a business together for fun.</p>

<p>Since they both loved food, the pair decided that their business would be homemade ice cream. They split the cost of a $5 course in ice cream-
making and passed, and believed they were ready to open their own business. They chose to open the first Ben & Jerry’s ice cream shop in 1978 in Burlington, 
Vermont, because it was so cold there that there was no other ice cream shops to compete against. They did not have much money, but with old equipment they
made it work, and were successful their first summer. However, they realized that they needed to continue to make money throughout the freezing winter, so
they sold their ice cream pints to local stores and restaurants. When a big ice cream distributer started selling their pints to big grocery stores around
the state, they knew that something big was about it happen with Ben & Jerry’s.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ben and Jerry reached a critical point in their business, when the big distributer (Pillsbury) that carried Ben & Jerry’s 
ice cream also carried Haagen-Dazs ice cream, who threatened to cancel their business with Pillsbury if they continued to sell Ben & Jerry’s brand. 
Pillsbury dropped Ben & Jerry’s, and the pair fought back with the “What’s the dough boy afraid of?” campaign. They encouraged customers to help by 
calling a toll free number they printed on their pints, and received nation-wide media covering the protest. Eventually, Pillsbury and Haagen-Dazs 
backed off, and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream was distributed across the country.</p>

<p>Ben and Jerry are not your typical businessmen. Jerry discussed how the company prides itself on having a different kind of business than usual. 
They didn’t want to just make profit; they wanted to have a positive impact on their community as well. They decided to “redefine the bottom line,” 
so the bottom line was not just about how much money the company made, it was also about how much they were able to give back to the community. 
Jerry said that most people thought this was a crazy idea, and there was no way that the new two-part bottom line could have a positive correlation. 
However, they were able to find plenty of ways to increase profits as well as give back to the community, such as buying chocolate brownies used 
in multiple ice cream flavors (they bought $5 million worth last year) from a nonprofit bakery that provides jobs for former addicts and ex-convicts. 
Ben & Jerry’s has never been afraid to take a stand on controversial issues. They brought out ice cream flavors to bring awareness to climate change, 
gay marriage rights and voting rights. Ben & Jerry’s has been in the news and has amassed various opinions regarding their allegiance with controversial 
issues, such as police brutality. Just recently, Ben & Jerry’s publically aligned themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement. At the top of their 
website is a picture of the slogan, “Black Lives Matter”, and links to several articles on the issue. The “Black Lives Matter” movement has gotten 
a lot of criticism and backlash from several claiming that the movement ignores the struggles of other racial backgrounds, and that it is racist to
White Americans, because of the focus on black lives. The typical response to the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter is #AllLivesMatter, and Ben & Jerry’s 
responds by saying, “All lives do matter. But all lives will not matter until black lives matter.”</p>

<p>Ben & Jerry’s social and political involvement might seem a little strange coming from an ice cream company. Some have even argued its involvement 
is mainly to sell more ice cream. Jerry Greenfield responded with, “Our actions are based on deeply held values.” Also, Ben and Jerry aren’t really 
businessmen, especially now that their company has been bought and they no longer are managers, their roles are really ambassadors. Jerry jokingly 
stated that since they’ve been bought by Unilever, they “have jobs where we have no responsibilities and no authority.” They represent the brand, 
and it is important to them that their values match the values of the brand, and that is not new. They have gotten arrested at the “Democracy Awakening” 
protests, to protect every citizen’s voice in the election and voting rights. We highly doubt that they would go so far as to risk getting arrested
more than once just to sell ice cream; Ben & Jerry’s is an inspiring company that truly cares about bringing awareness to issues and making a positive 
impact on the community.</p>
 
<h3><a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/tcnj/president-bill-clinton-speaks-tcnj" target="_blank">Bill Clinton Speaks at TCNJ</a></h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
<p>The College of New Jersey had a very special guest this Friday, May 13th- the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Students of the college and members of the community came out to see the former President speak about his wife’s, Hillary Rodham Clinton, candidacy for this year’s presidential election. The event was very well attended, as the line to get into Packer Hall stretched back to Wolfe Hall as students and visitors waited with umbrellas in the rain.</p> 
<p>The basketball court was packed; the bleachers were filled and the floor surrounding the stage was crammed with people. The podium and banner behind the stage displayed the same slogan: ‘Fighting for us.’ A few signs were held up in the crowd, with phrases such as ‘TCNJ (hearts) Hillary’ and ‘I’m with HER,’ along with a mother-daughter group held bright pink signs that read ‘Girl Power!’</p>
<p>The scoreboard was even changed for the event; the time was set at 20:16, while the Home score was changed to 45 and the Visitor’s to 42, referring to the 42nd President speaking about his wife possibly becoming the 45th President.</p> 
<p>After Clinton was introduced, the entire crowd stood to their feet and cheered, while it seemed like every pair of arms were holding up smart phones and cameras, ready to capture the moment the former President stepped onto the stage.</p> 
<p>As Clinton thanked everyone for coming, he singled out the students in the crowd, stating that he especially wants to thank the students for coming and getting involved. He then went on the talk about the top three reasons why he believes Hillary is the best candidate:</p>
<p>“I think she’s got the best ideas that are most likely to help the largest amount of people, to raise middle class incomes, restore upward mobility, reduce inequality, and launch an explosive economic activity in this country.”</p>
<p>“Second, she’s the only person left in either party that’s got a record of getting things done with members of the other party.”</p>
<p>“Third, she’s the only person extremely qualified to keep bad things from happening and to give us both the safety and the space we need to grow.”</p>
<p>Clinton then discussed some of Hillary’s thoughts on policies, including her belief that students should graduate debt-free, and any debt that graduates currently have should be turned into a mortgage to make to easier for students to pay off over time. He also discussed her stance against the fact that many Americans do not get paid leave when they have children, “You cannot ask a family to choose between succeeding in work and succeeding in raising children.”</p>
<p>Clinton then took a little jab at Trump’s slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ by saying that America wasn’t always so great for everyone. Clinton states that things are much better now and we are a country with more diversity and acceptance, “America is so much less sexist, racist, homophobic and religiously bigoted than it used to be.” However, Clinton states that there is definitely still sexism, racism, homophobia and bigotry in the U.S., and not enough open conversations.</p>
<p>When discussing the need for more open conversations, Clinton says that people tend to not talk to people they disagree with, but rather just ignore them: “The one thing that has gotten worse is we can’t stand to be around anybody that disagrees with us anymore, and that’s dangerous for Democracy.” Clinton referred to a speech he held just a few days prior, where he was booed as he stepped on stage. Instead of allowing his security to remove the people who booed, he asked for them to talk to him after the event to openly discuss their concerns and ask questions.</p>
<p>He then continued to discuss all of Hillary’s achievements and goals, “Hillary is not gonna give up on any American, she wants us to all rise together.” The main takeaway from Clinton’s speech could not be missed, as he kept going back to the same phrase (maybe one too many times…) that we can all rise together as a nation.</p>
<p>Clinton ended his speech on a positive note, stating that Hillary is the best candidate because she is a change-maker, she finds a way to make something good happen for someone else every day, and she wants the best for our country and people. “And if you want that too,” Clinton concludes, “I hope that you vote for her for President. Thank you and God bless.”</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/tcnj/katie-king-softball-player-future-teacher" target="_blank">Katie King: Softball Player & Future Teacher</a></h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
 <p>This week’s Profile is on Katie King, a senior Early Childhood Education and Psychology major who does it all! She is co-president of TCNJ’s Club Softball team, a softball coach, president of Omicron Delta Kappa (the Leadership Honor Society,) as well as the co-VP of Retreats in Catholic Campus Ministry (CCM.) She is also aspiring to be a kindergarten or first grade teacher after graduating in May.</p>
<p>CCM is an important part of Katie’s life, and she describes one of her most memorable mission trips through Almost Heaven Habitat for Humanity as one of the most fulfilling experiences of her life, “we helped finish and fix up houses for some very deserving people from dedicated community members to a Veteran. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I cannot wait to go back again this spring break.”</p>
<p>Another big part of Katie’s life is softball, which she started playing at the young age of 7. However, she wasn’t serious about playing until 5th grade, when she credits a really great coach to sparking her love for the sport and getting her involved with travel teams.</p>
<p>She then joined the club softball team her first semester of freshman year at TCNJ, and has had many great memories from her 4 years on the team: “My favorite club softball memories are from playing, traveling, and bonding with my teammates. One instance that sticks out was when we traveled to play in a tournament in Virginia. We played at a beautiful facility, on the side of a mountain, against colleges from around the country and even got to experience what it is like to play in the freezing cold and snow! Even though we did not get the results we wanted from the weekend, and our last game was snowed out, I loved bonding with my teammates and making memories. My mom also made the trip so it was great to share this experience with her as well.”</p>
<p>Katie has been president of the team for 2 years- (this year, she has a co-president, Eva Motto.) The club softball team does not have an appointed coach, so the co-presidents act as coaches as well as players. This means that Katie has many different responsibilities: “My co-president and I are in charge of scheduling games against other colleges in and out of our conference, making travel accommodations, arranging our practice schedule, running practices, determining the roster and lineups for each game, and attending meetings and being involved in the decisions of the SCAC (Sport Club Advisory Council).”</p>
<p>Even though it comes with many responsibilities, Katie says that being co-president is a very rewarding position, “There is a lot of behind the scenes work that goes on that I did not realize before I took the position, but when all of the planning and scheduling comes together and all of us are able to just play the sport we love it makes it all worth it.” She also says that the position helped prepare her for coaching, another passion of hers.</p>
<p>She coaches two travel softball teams in the summer of girls between 8 and 12 years old. Katie wants to continue her coaching career after graduation, and hopes to eventually form a travel team of her own or coach for a high school team.</p>
<p>While she loves to coach softball, Katie has always known that she wanted to be a teacher: “Ever since I was little, I wanted to become a teacher. When I was in kindergarten, I used to come home, set up a little classroom, and teach my little brother everything I learned in kindergarten.”</p>
<p>She credits her inspiration to become an Early Childhood Education major to her teachers, “I had some amazing teachers throughout the years who have really inspired me to become a teacher so I can make an impact on children’s lives like they made an impact on mine.” She is also a former Girl Scout, and says that mentoring younger students showed her how much she loved making connections and teaching new things. Katie praises her parents as her greatest teachers and role models, “they really encourage and support me to become the best teacher I can be.”</p>
<p>Katie also says that student teaching last semester made her love teaching even more, and convinced her that she was meant to be a teacher: “It was more than I ever expected it could be. I was in a kindergarten classroom with students whose love for learning inspired me. They really are role models for me as well because when you see their bright eyed, excited faces ready to learn every day it makes teaching not seem like a job. My experience definitely made me realize that an early childhood setting is the right place for me.”</p>
<p>She is very excited for the future and life after graduation, “I have dreamt of having my own classroom so I cannot wait to see what the future holds.” Good luck Katie!

<h3><a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/tcnj/delicious-beer-drink-national-beer-day"target="_blank">Delicious Beer to Drink on National Beer Day</a></h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
<p>April 7th is National Beer Day! If you are someone who doesn’t like the taste of regular beer, you are not alone, this list is for you. Here are a few options of delicious “beer” to drink for people who don’t like beer.</p>
<p>1. Angry Orchard</p>
<p>Although Angry Orchard is technically a hard cider rather than a beer, it is very popular at restaurants and bars usually have it on tap. With many different options, including Crisp Apple, Green Apple, Apple Ginger and Summer Honey, you really can’t get a better tasting drink if you love cider.</p>
<p>2. Redds Apple Ale</p>
<p>Redd’s Apple Ale is similar to Angry Orchard, but it’s not a hard cider- it is really a beer brewed with apple flavor. So, if you want to be technically correct and drink real beer on National Beer Day but still want a delicious apple flavor, Redds is the drink for you.</p>
<p>3. Leinenkugel Shandy’s</p>
<p>A traditional shandy is beer mixed with a little something extra, like lemonade, soda or ginger ale. Leinenkugel makes many different types, including their Grapefruit and Summer Shandy’s.  Each batch begins with traditional weiss beer; the Grapefruit Shandy is combined with natural white grapefruit flavor, while the Summer Shandy is made with natural lemonade flavor. Both are great options for someone who wants to try a fruity and refreshing beer! (Grapefruit Shandy is available year round, while Summer Shandy is only available in the summer.)</p>
<p>4. Hard Root Beer</p>
<p>Hard Root Beer is becoming a very popular drink, and for good reason! Hard root beer tastes very similar to a regular root beer soda, without much taste of alcohol (some say they can’t taste any alcohol at all!) Many brewers are making their own version of hard root beer, so it won’t be hard to find. Some include Not Your Father’s Root Beer, Forbidden Root, and Sprecher Fire Brewed Hard Root Beer.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/tcnj/perfect-fall-playlist"target="_blank">The Perfect Fall Playlist</a></h3>
<h4>Abby Burns</h4>
<p>A new season means new songs, and what better way to start off with than an awesome Fall playlist!</p>
<p>There’s no better time to create a new playlist than right now, as many artists have been dropping new albums and singles. Pop stars like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Maroon 5 and One Direction have just realeased new music, and we couldn’t be more excited.</p>
<p>These hits are sure to put you in a great mood while walking to class, getting ready in the morning or as background music while studying in the library.</p>
<p>1.     “Shake It Off” – Taylor Swift</p>         
<p>The first single off her new album, 1989, out this October, is a song that reminds us why we love this girl. She doesn’t care about what anyone says about her and just wants to have fun and dance. This catchy song is perfect to sing along and dance to with your girlfriends and is a must have on your new fall playlist.</p>
<p>2.     “Best Mistake” – Ariana Grande featuring Big Sean</p>
<p>Ariana has blown up this year. Her new album, My Everything, is full of future hits that are sure to be on the radio in the upcoming months. Her new rumored love interest, Big Sean, re-teamed with Grande for this somber love song.</p>
<p>3.     “Lost Stars” – Maroon 5</p>
<p>This hit was featured in Adam Levine’s first movie debut, Begin Again, released over the summer, and is included on Maroon 5’s new album, V. Levine’s voice is beatiful on this track, as always, and is the perfect slow song to listen to while studying or relaxing with a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>4.     “Fireproof” – One Direction</p>
<p>One Direction just announced that their new album, FOUR, will be out this November. As if that news isn’t exciting enough, they’ve released a new single.  “Fireproof” is a must-have new edition to your music library, and before you know it you’ll have the song on repeat all day long.</p>
<p>5.     “Don’t” - Ed Sheeran</p>
<p>Ed’s new single off his lastest album, X, is making it’s way up the charts and is played on the radio frequently. This track has all things we love about Ed; his raps, his catchy chorus and his wonderfully written lyrics.</p>
<p>6.     “Animals” – Maroon 5</p>
<p>This is the second single off Maroon 5’s new album and is already predicted to beat their current number one hit, “Maps,” on the charts.</p>
<p>7.     “XO” – John Mayer</p>
<p>It’s always a risk to cover a Beyonce song, but let’s be honest, John Mayer can cover any song and sound beautiful. This cover is the perfect acoustic-pop song to listen to when you just want to relax in the cool weather and shut out the world.</p>
<p>8.     “OctaHate” - Ryn Weaver</p>
<p>This song is not as popular, but it definitely has the potential to be a hit. Weaver’s voice has a very cool vibe and will be your new favorite song before you know it.</p>
<p>9.     “Break Your Heart Right Back” – Ariana Grande ft. Childish Gambino</p>
<p>From Big Sean to Mac Miller to Iggy Azeala, Ariana features more rappers on her tracks than almost any other pop star. But we won’t complain, because they’re all chart toppers that become our guilty pleasures. This song featuring Childish Gambino is no exception and is sure to be one of your most played songs this Fall.</p>
<p>10. “Thinking Out Loud” - Ed Sheeran</p>
<p>Yes, another track off Sheeran’s album, X, and this one is sure to be one of your favorite Ed songs. A contrast to the breakup song “Don’t,” this love song features beautiful lyrics, Ed’s soulful voice and is another great acoustic song to add to your playlist.</p>
